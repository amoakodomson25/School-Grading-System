# School-Grading-System

PROJECT TOPIC: Develop a PYTHON Program for a grading system that satisfies the
following requirements.
1. Requirement for passing an exam is that, student must pass the exam by a score of 25 or
more and must also pass the assessment by 15 or more to get a certificate.
2. If a student score a total grade of 39 both grading component (i.e. if only a student score
exam 25 and assessment 14 totaling 39, or exam 24 and assessment 15 totaling 39), the
student is condoned.
3. If a student satisfy either Requirement 1 or Requirement. 2 and have paid their fees in full
(where fee is 100), they are issued with a certificate.
4. A student is deemed to have failed if he/she does not meet Requirement. 1 or
Requirement. 2
5. However, your program must inform a student which component he/ she passed/failed.
6. Where a student fail both components he/she is repeated.


NOTE:
a. Python does not provide a switch case statement, but it offers few workarounds to
make this statement work like The (if-else conditions).
b. The program should accept data(input) from the user.
c. Let your program generate summary of the student report including the students
full name, department and course of study.
